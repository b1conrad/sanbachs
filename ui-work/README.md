The index.html file is an idea of how one might manage a pico and its children.

validate.html is a clone of https://cs.kobj.net/manage/validate/ with line numbers
--to use it, paste a ruleset in the box and click "Validate!"
--if no errors, great
--remember some of the line numbers and go back in the browser to see the ruleset with line numbers
This should be incorporated into the official validate page
